# Youtube-Content-Warning-Skipper
This is a Youtube content warning skipper. Leave your videos on in the background without worrying about obtrusive content warnings that ruin your flow.
## Installation:
Download this repo as a zip and drag the folder (inside the zip) into chrome://extensions. If it doesn't work, make sure that developer mode is enabled (at the top right of the page).
## Why bother using this?
I often leave Youtube on in a background tab to play music and nothing infuriates me further than having my music paused just because "The following content may contain topics related to suicide or self-harm."
## How come this isn't published on the Chrome Webstore?
I'm not paying 5 dollars for a developer license on the Chrome Webstore.
## Known Issues:
- When watching a playlist and a video with a content warning loads, it causes the video to play for less than a second before restarting from 0s. Probably caused by Youtube changing the URL on button click, then changing the URL again for reasons not known to this mortal world.
