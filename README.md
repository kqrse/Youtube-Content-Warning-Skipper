# Youtube-Content-Warning-Skipper
Skip annoying Content Warnings from Youtube
## Installation:
Download the repo as a zip and drag the folder into chrome://extensions. If it doesn't work, make sure that developer mode is enabled (at the top right of the page).
## Why bother using this?
I often leave Youtube on in a background tab to play music and nothing infuriates me further than being warned that a song has offensive or violet themes.
